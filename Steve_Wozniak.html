                <p class="lead">The “Steves” likely require no introduction, but they started Apple Computer in 1976.  Their first computer was built by Wozniak and sold by Jobs.  The Apple II was the machine that really launched Apple Computer into the mainstream.   Jobs was kicked out of Apple in 1985. He started a new company NeXT Inc. and Pixar.   In 1997 he returned as the CEO and remained there until he died in 2011. Wozniak also left Apple in 1985. He earned his teaching degree online under an assumed name and taught high school and middle school for several years before returning to technology as a speaker and writer.
